# Hip-Hip-Socket

A simple server/client socket.io bi-directional data flow example.

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:Flowdeeps/hip-hip-socket.git`

`cd hip-hip-socket`

`npm i`

`npm run start`

You'll need to have two browser panes open, the first to `http://0.0.0.0:3000` and the second to `http://0.0.0.0:3000/client`

Moving your cursor around in the client P5 canvas will cause the server P5 canvas ellipse to change shape. Clicking on the client link will cause a message to appear in the server empty paragraph.
